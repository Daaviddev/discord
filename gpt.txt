Set up the /buy and /sell slash commands.
When the command is invoked, show a modal to collect the initial trade details.
After the modal is submitted, send a message with the collected info and include select menus for further details.
select menu : 
Select Type : 
 .addOptions([
        {
          label: "Spot",
          value: "Spot",
        },
        {
          label: "10x-20x",
          value: "10x-20x",
        },
        {
          label: "20x-50x",
          value: "20x-50x",
        },
        {
          label: "50x-100x",
          value: "50x-100x",
        },
        {
          label: "100x+",
          value: "100x+",
        },
 ])

Use buttons to add additional options like "AddTP" and "Additional".

AddTP button: opens modal with 4 input boxes for TP1, TP2, TP3, TP4 - this is not mandatory info
Additional button: add input field for -Trade Risk, Trade Length -  this is not mandatory info
Submit button: submits all information given, create thread, send embed with all info into thread 

The "Submit" button would finalize the trade, create a thread, and post an embed with all the information and image from slash command.


Ensure all new files are correctly referenced in your main bot file (bot.js) or any other relevant files.
Implement appropriate error handling and input validation.
The placeholders (like // ...) in the code snippets should be filled with specific details based on your project's requirements and existing code structure.
